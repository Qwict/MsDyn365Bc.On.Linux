# publish-app.sh — Shared "publish a .app to a running BC instance" helper.
#
# Designed to be SOURCED, not executed:
#
#   . "$REPO_DIR/scripts/publish-app.sh"
#   bc_publish_app /path/to/myapp.app
#   bc_publish_app /path/to/myapp.app "http://localhost:7049/BC/dev" "BCRUNNER:Admin123!"
#
# Returns 0 on success — meaning either:
#   - HTTP 200 (fresh publish completed), or
#   - HTTP 422 whose body says the extension is already deployed/installed/
#     published (BC reports that as a 422 even though it isn't a real
#     error).
#
# Returns 1 (and prints a diagnostic dump) for everything else, including
# any other 4xx/5xx and 422s that don't match one of those specific benign
# phrases. The most common 422 failure is "missing dependency" — when the
# .app declares a dependency on another extension that isn't installed in
# the BC database. The pre-2026 version of this code treated ALL 422s as
# "already installed" and silently swallowed missing-dep failures, which
# made for many wasted debugging cycles in downstream consumers like
# bc-copilot-blueprint. Now those failures are loud and have a clear
# error body printed.
#
# A later version of this code matched any 422 body containing the bare
# substring "already" — too loose. A genuine install-time AL failure can
# say e.g. "The record in table Install Seed already exists", which isn't
# benign at all: BC's error message says "The original extensions have
# been restored" (i.e. the publish was rolled back), but the bare-substring
# check treated it as success anyway, so the app was silently never
# installed and every subsequent test-codeunit lookup failed with
# "not found".
#
# So: match BC's known benign phrasings (already deployed/installed/
# published/exists, or "duplicate package ID" — the latter is what a
# republish of an identical already-published package looks like, e.g.
# run-tests.sh re-publishing a test app the workflow's earlier "Publish AL
# apps" step already published), but explicitly exclude any body that says
# the publish itself failed (BC wraps genuine install-trigger errors in
# "Publishing failed due to 'Could not install the extension ...'" and
# "The original extensions have been restored") even if that body also
# happens to contain one of the benign words.
