"""Fail when examples/ drifts from the reusable workflows in .github/workflows/.

Why this exists
---------------
The four starter pipelines under examples/ duplicate, in two CI dialects,
logic that also lives in the reusable workflows. Nothing executes them — they
are templates for consumers to copy — so a fix applied to the reusable
workflow reaches everyone using it while the examples silently rot. Issue #20
was reported after issue #19 found three separate instances of exactly that:
glob-based symbol staging, a `dotnet tool install` that fails silently on
BC 28, and an Azure Pipelines license guard that misreads an undefined
variable. Every consumer who copied an example rather than calling the
reusable workflow was broken, for weeks, invisibly.

The structural fix is for the examples to CALL the shared scripts rather than
inline copies of their logic — then a fix to a script reaches them the same
way it reaches the reusable workflow. This check enforces that property:

  1. Every shared script the reusable workflow uses must also be used by the
     corresponding examples, unless explicitly exempted here with a reason.
     This is the check that catches "I added a script and wired it into the
     reusable workflow only" — which is how resolve-al-tool-version.py drifted
     within an hour of being written.

  2. The two dialects must use the same set of shared scripts as each other.
     Fixing github-workflows/ and forgetting azure-pipelines/ is a recurring
     failure mode; parity is cheap to assert.

  3. Constants that now come from a resolver must not be hardcoded anywhere.
     A pinned AL compiler version in an example is drift waiting to happen —
     it will be wrong at the next BC release and fail in a way that points
     somewhere unrelated.

This is a static check. It cannot prove an example RUNS. Running them in CI
would be a stronger guard and is worth doing eventually; this catches the
class of defect that has actually occurred so far, in about a second.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-example-drift.py          # report and exit non-zero on drift
    python3 scripts/check-example-drift.py --list   # just show what each file uses
